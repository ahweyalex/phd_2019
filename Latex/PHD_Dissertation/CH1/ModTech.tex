A brief mentioned two basic modulation techniques used within RFID is amplitude shift keying (ASK) and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). ASK represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier wave. The binary symbol 1 is represented as a duration of T seconds at a fixed-amplitude and binary symbol is for all other cases that are not that fixed-amplitude. BPSK (or PRK or 2PSK), a form of phase-shift keying, is a two-phase modulation scheme. The signal has two different phase states in the carrier signal, $\theta=0^\circ$ (binary 1) and $\theta=180^\circ$ (binary 0). In Figure [] shows an example of these two modulation schemes.
