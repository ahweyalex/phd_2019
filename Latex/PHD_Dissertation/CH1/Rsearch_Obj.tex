The research objectives are separated into two projects. Project one, the biological research's research objective is to provide a simple implementation to design multi-coiled wire antennas that yields a higher read-range and inductance for near-field RFID systems. This tool will decrease development time of fabrication of the multi-coiled wire antennas, provide an insight of multi-coiled wire antenna designs, and provide alternate design suggestions for improved read-range.  

Project two is to optimize RFID tag's coupling based on orientation and position placement upon a canonical metallic object's current distribution to increase modulated far-field back-scatter (read-range). %This dissertation will report its findings, provide design guidelines, and  

% The research objectives are separated into two projects. The first project as previously discussed involves bio-logging using an inexpensive open-source RFID tag system. The objectives is to create a GUI software tool to enable non-antenna engineers to rapidly prototype multi-coiled wire antennas for LF and HF frequencies bands, provide design improvements, provide a software user guide, and instructions on the construction of multi-coiled wire antennas. The second project involves the investigation of impact on modulated back-scattering of metallic object with placement of RFID tag. This investigation will report the findings that include bounds in which the modulated back-scattering is impacted upon RFID tag's placement, those effects upon modulated back-scattering, and recommend placement of the tag on the metallic object.
