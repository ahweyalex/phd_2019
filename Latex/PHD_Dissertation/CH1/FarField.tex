This modulation can be encoded to retrieve the tag's data. The modulated back-scatter (or far-field coupling) retrieves the electromagnetic waves from the tag's antenna when not within the near-fields. These tags are typically designed for a frequency band such that there is a mismatch causing energy to be reflected back to the reader. The tag's impedance can be changed over-time to cause modulation, this modulation can be encoded by the reader to obtain the tag's data. Typically modulated back-scatter operates within the UHF frequency band.Â
