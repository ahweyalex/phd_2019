The research objectives are separated into two projects. The first project as previously discussed involves bio-logging using an inexpensive open-source RFID tag system. The objectives is to create a GUI software tool to enable non-antenna engineers to rapidly prototype multi-coiled wire antennas for LF and HF frequencies bands, provide design improvements, provide a software user guide, and instructions on the construction of multi-coiled wire antennas. The second project involves the investigation of impact on RCS of metallic object with placement of RFID tag. This investigation will report the findings that include bounds in which the RCS is impacted upon RFID tag's placement, those effects upon RCS, and recommend placement of the tag on the metallic object.
